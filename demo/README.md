## Terminology

### Active window

The set of words currently being studied in a session. Size is controlled by `wordsPerBatch` in `LEARNING_CONFIG`. A word stays in the active window until it is mastered, at which point it is retired and the next word from the queue takes its slot.

### Queue

Words waiting to enter the active window. Words are promoted from queue → active one at a time as slots free up through mastery.

### Batch

One round of questions served to the learner. A batch is composed from the active window — each active word generates one or more questions via the composer registry. After ST03, batch length is **variable**: re-serve retries can extend it beyond `wordsPerBatch`.

### `wordsPerBatch`

How many word items can be in the active window at once. This is a **slot count**, not a question count. Set to `3` by default.

After the re-serve loop is implemented (ST03), a single batch may contain more than `wordsPerBatch` questions because wrong answers are re-queued within the batch. `wordsPerBatch` bounds the *words in play*, not the *questions asked*.

### `questionLimit` (composer option)

A separate concept from `wordsPerBatch`. The `{ questionLimit }` option on `composeWordBatchItems` caps the number of MCQ questions that composer generates from a given word set. Lives in the engine layer (`compose-word-batch.ts`) and is unrelated to active window size.

### Re-serve loop (ST03, upcoming)

After a wrong answer, the identical question is re-queued within the current batch. Controlled by two caps:

| Constant | Scope | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `maxRetryPerWord` | Per batch — max re-serves for one word within a single batch | 2 |
| `maxRetryPerSession` | Per session — max re-serves for one word across the entire `runAdaptiveLoop` call | 6 |

Words that exhaust `maxRetryPerWord` carry over to the next batch. Words that exhaust `maxRetryPerSession` are shelved for the session.

**Effect on the queue:** The queue is not touched by ST03. Re-serves are internal to `runBatch` — they replay a cached question and never promote or demote anything. The queue only moves when `nextActivePool` is called *between* batches. A word that exhausts `maxRetryPerSession` is excluded from future active pools, which means it will never be promoted from active → mastered through normal means, but it does not re-enter the queue either — it is simply skipped when `nextActivePool` fills slots.

```
Batch N (re-serve loop active):
  active = [w1, w2, w3]   queue = [w4, w5]

  w2 answered wrong → re-queued inside runBatch (internal retry queue)
  w2 answered wrong again → maxRetryPerWord(2) exhausted → batch closes
  queue = [w4, w5]   ← unchanged, re-serve loop never touched it

Between batch N and N+1 (nextActivePool):
  w1 mastered → retired
  → pulls w4 from queue

  active = [w2, w3, w4]   queue = [w5]
  (w2 still in active because it was not mastered — it carries over)
```

### Composer registry

The session layer registers each active composer as a pre-bound thunk `() => QuizQuestion[]` before calling `assembleBatchQuestions(registry)`. This produces a flat merged `QuizQuestion[]` without any direct coupling between composers. Adding a new question type (e.g. audio) is a registration, not a change to session logic.

### `SentenceState` (ST04/ST05, upcoming)

Per-sentence tracking required for spacing and shelving rules. Distinct from `WordState` — sentence mastery and word mastery are independent tracks.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sentenceStreak` | Consecutive correct answers — streak-based exit |
| `lastBatchSeen` | Batch sequence number — prevents back-to-back appearances |
| `dailyCount` | Times served this session (session = day in demo) — daily cap |
| `sessionWrongStreak` | Consecutive wrong answers this session — auto-shelve trigger |
| `active` | Whether the sentence is in the active pool |

## Config reference (`demo/config.ts`)

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wordsPerBatch` | number | Active window size — words in play per batch |
| `masteryThreshold` | number | Mastery score required to retire a word |
| `maxMastery` | number | Maximum mastery score |
| `correctStreakThreshold` | number | Correct streak needed to increment mastery |
| `wrongStreakThreshold` | number | Wrong streak needed to decrement mastery |
